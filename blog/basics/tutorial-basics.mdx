### What are Tokenized Stocks?

**Tokenized stocks** are digital representations of traditional stocks on the blockchain. They maintain a 1:1 value peg with real stocks through smart contracts.

Imagine traditional stocks as paper stock certificates, while tokenized stocks are the digital version of these certificates, stored on the blockchain.

**Core Features**:

- ‚ö° **Instant Settlement**: Trades complete immediately, no T+2 waiting
- üåç **Global Access**: Can trade from anywhere
- üîó **DeFi Integration**: Can participate in lending, liquidity mining, etc.

### Tokenized vs Traditional Stocks
