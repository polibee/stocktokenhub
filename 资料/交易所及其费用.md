Detailed Summary
As of Jun 26, 2025, the US stock market has been reaching nearly all-time highs, capturing the attention of investors globally. For crypto traders, however, accessing these opportunities has often meant navigating between separate platforms and converting digital assets to fiat. 

That barrier is now being removed, as Bybit has partnered with Backed Finance, a leader in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, to bring xStocks directly to the Bybit Spot market. This launch allows you to trade on-chain, tokenized versions of top US stocks 24/7 using USDT. In this article, we’ll explore what xStocks is, how it works, its key benefits and how you can start trading it on Bybit Spot.

Key Takeaways:

Bybit has launched xStocks, and you can now trade fully-backed tokenized stocks on Bybit Spot 24/7.

Backed Assets (JE) Limited (a Jersey private limited company) is the issuer of xStocks, which is designed to be 1:1 representations of real-world stocks like Apple, Tesla and NVIDIA.

Unlike CFDs, xStocks provides investors with ownership of the underlying asset and are freely transferable on the blockchain.


Bybit introduces on-chain stock trading with xStocks
In a move to provide a gateway between crypto and traditional finance, Bybit has partnered with Backed Finance to launch xStocks. This collaboration brings fully compliant, tokenized stocks to Bybit Spot, offering users a novel way to invest in equities.

By participating in xStocks spot trading on Bybit, traders can gain early access to tokenized equities, a brand-new class of investment products. This provides first-mover advantages in a new market, access to blockchain-based stocks with 24/7 trading and the ability to diversify portfolios seamlessly. Bybit supports this launch with first-class liquidity, positioning itself as a premier destination for on-chain stock trading.

What are tokenized/on-chain stocks?
Tokenized stocks, or on-chain stocks, are digital representations of traditional shares issued on a blockchain. Each token corresponds to a fraction or whole share of an underlying stock, enabling investors to buy, sell and trade these shares on the blockchain.

What on-chain stocks can you trade on Bybit?
The initial launch includes ten of the most popular and influential US stocks, available for trading against the USDT stablecoin. The list features Magnificent Seven tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) and crypto stocks like Strategy (MSTR), Robinhood (HOOD) and Circle (CRCL).

The tokenized stocks will be listed on Bybit Spot under the Adventure Zone, starting from Jun 30, 2 PM UTC. Note that a trading rate of 0.2% and position size limit of 300,000 USDT applies.

What are xStocks?
xStocks is issued by Backed Assets (JE) Limited, a Jersey private limited company issuance entity in Jersey wholly owned by Backed Finance. Founded in 2021, Backed issues xStocks as digital tracker certificates designed to reflect the economic exposure of individual public listed equities and ETFs.

Each xStock is a digital token structured to correspond on a 1:1 basis with an underlying share, with the issuer maintaining that an equivalent share is held in custody for each token in circulation.

These are not derivatives, but fully collateralized digital assets. They’re issued as tracker certificates under a MiFID II–compliant EU prospectus and supported by regulated custodians in Switzerland and the US, as represented by the issuer. xStocks are initially available on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the transparency and efficiency of its on-chain infrastructure to facilitate access to traditional asset exposure. While Bybit facilitates access to xStocks through its platform for eligible users, it does not issue or sell xStocks, and does not guarantee the delivery or redemption of the underlying shares. Users should review the relevant disclosures and documentation provided by the issuer and conduct their own due diligence before trading xStocks.

How to trade xStocks on Bybit Spot
Trading xStocks on Bybit is as simple as trading any other cryptocurrency on the Spot market. To get started, follow these easy instructions:

Log in or create a Bybit account, and complete the necessary KYC level 1 verification.

Navigate to Bybit Spot in the Bybit App or on the Bybit website.

Search for the desired xStock token using its ticker (The first ten stocks to be listed are: COINX, NVDAX, CRCLX, AAPLX, HOODX, METAX, GOOGLX, AMZNX, TSLAX, MCDX). 

Choose your order type (Market, Limit or Conditional)

Enter the amount of USDT you wish to trade. 

Confirm the transaction.

All xStock pairs on Bybit are quoted against USDT, allowing for quick and easy transactions using your stablecoin balance. With 24/7 availability and near-instant settlement, you can react to market opportunities anytime, anywhere.

How xStocks trading on Bybit works: Mechanism and market dynamics
The value of xStocks is designed to track the price of the corresponding underlying equity through a pegging and arbitrage mechanism maintained by the issuer. According to Backed Finance, each token is backed 1:1 by an actual share held with a regulated third-party custodian, and token issuance is structured to be verifiable on-chain.

Market participants, including market makers, play a crucial role by issuing and redeeming tokens from the issuer based on supply and demand dynamics. If the price of an xStock on Bybit deviates from the price of the underlying stock on exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq, arbitrageurs are incentivized to close the gap, much as they do in stablecoin markets.

This mechanism creates two interconnected markets: 

The primary market (US stock exchanges) is open during standard trading hours, and serves as the price anchor. 

The secondary market (on-chain trading on Bybit) operates 24/7. 

Outside of US market hours, the price of an xStock may float slightly, acting as a prediction market based on pre-market or after-hours news and sentiment.

Key features and benefits of xStocks
xStocks are designed as a superior way to access equities on-chain, and they offer several unique features. One key feature is 24/7 trading availability. Unlike traditional stock markets that operate on fixed schedules, xStocks can be traded anytime on the Bybit Spot market.

To ensure investors receive the full economic benefit of the underlying share, xStocks use a rebasing mechanism. This automatically adjusts the number of tokens in a holder's wallet to reflect corporate actions such as dividends or stock splits without requiring any action from the user.

Benefits for traders are significant: the blockchain provides full transparency of ownership and collateral, and allows for fractional ownership, making it easier to invest in high-priced stocks. Furthermore, transactions benefit from the efficient settlement times of the blockchain, clearing in near–real time instead of the multi-day settlement of traditional markets.

Why trade xStocks on Bybit?
As a top-tier crypto exchange, Bybit provides an ideal environment for trading xStocks. Users benefit from deep liquidity and a familiar, user-friendly interface. The platform allows you to trade these on-chain US stocks directly with stablecoins such as USDT, removing the need for traditional brokerage accounts and complex fiat onboarding processes.

This 24/7 access is perfect for global traders in different time zones who want to react to market news without waiting for Wall Street to open. Most importantly, it enables true portfolio diversification. Crypto traders can now easily capture the upside of the strong performance in US equities markets directly within their Bybit accounts.

xStocks vs. Stock CFDs on Bybit TradFi
Bybit offers two distinct ways to get exposure to stocks: xStocks on the Spot market and stock CFDs on Bybit TradFi Trading. While both provide access to stock price movements, they’re fundamentally different products.

Trade on-chain stocks on Bybit now
The launch of xStocks on Bybit marks a significant step in bridging the gap between traditional equities and the digital asset market. This innovative product offers the security and value of real-world stocks with the efficiency, accessibility and 24/7 availability of crypto.

The fast-growing real-word asset (RWA) tokenization market has hit $24 billion as of June this year, and is projected to reach $50 billion by the end of the year. With strong advocates for tokenization from notable investors like Blackrock’s Larry Fink, and regulatory clarity in the US paving the way, tokenization could rapidly transform traditional and tangible assets like real estate, commodities, bonds and equities into digital tokens on blockchain.

By providing a platform for these tokenized assets, Bybit empowers users to diversify their portfolios and engage with global markets in a truly modern, on-chain environment.

What do I pay to trade on Jupiter?
Not yet followed by anyone
When trading on Jupiter, you pay a fee to the Solana Blockchain, and sometimes a fee to Jupiter.

Trading on Jupiter:

- Solana Fees: The cost of interacting with the Solana network. Jupiter dynamically decides the fee for you in Ultra mode.

- Jito Tip: A fee paid to Jito for interacting with Solana, if you are using MEV-protect or Jito only mode. 

- A commission to Jupiter, usually on Jupiter Perps, Jupiter Ultra or when Recurring and Trigger Orders are filled. Manual Swaps are free. 

Note that Solana Fees are paid to Solana, regardless of your trade going through. Jupiter dynamically adjusts your fees to maximize your chances of landing your trade on Ultra Mode. 
Fees
Not yet followed by anyone
Base Fees
A flat rate of 0.06% of the position amount is charged when opening or closing a position. This base fee is also charged when a position is closed partially.

To calculate the base open or close for a trade:

Copy
BPS_POWER = 10^4 // 10_000 // 1. Get the base fee (BPS) from the custody account's `increasePositionBps` for open position requests // or `decreasePositionBps` for close position requests // <https://github.com/julianfssen/jupiter-perps-anchor-idl-parsing/blob/main/src/idl/jupiter-perpetuals-idl.ts#L2677> baseFeeBps = custody.increasePositionBps // 2. Convert `baseFeeBps` to decimals baseFeeBpsDecimals = baseFeeBps / BPS_POWER // 3. Calculate the final open / close fee in USD by multiplying `baseFeeBpsDecimals` against the trade size openCloseFeeUsd = tradeSizeUsd * baseFeeBpsDecimals
This code snippet contains an example on calculating open and close base fees programmatically.

 
Price Impact Fees
When trading on Jupiter Perpetuals, large trades don't incur price impact due to the use of price oracles for token prices.

To address this, Jupiter Perpetuals implements a price impact fee, which simulates the price impact on traditional exchanges (price changes due to limited liquidity at each price level).



How to Calculate the Price Impact Fee:
Copy
USDC_DECIMALS = 10^6  // 1_000_000
BPS_POWER = 10^4      // 10_000

Calculate Price Impact Fee:

// 1. Get the trade impact fee scalar from the custody account's `pricing.tradeImpactFeeScalar` constant
// <https://dev.jup.ag/docs/perp-api/custody-account>
   tradeImpactFeeScalar = custody.pricing.tradeImpactFeeScalar

// 2. Convert trade size to USDC decimal format
   tradeSizeUsd = tradeSizeUsd * USDC_DECIMALS

// 3. Scale to BPS format for fee calculation
   tradeSizeUsdBps = tradeSizeUsd * BPS_POWER

// 4. Calculate price impact fee percentage in BPS
   priceImpactFeeBps = tradeSizeUsdBps / tradeImpactFeeScalar

// 5. Calculate final price impact fee in USD
   priceImpactFeeUsd = (tradeSizeUsd * priceImpactFeeBps / BPS_POWER) / USDC_DECIMALS
This code snippet contains an example on calculating price impact fees programmatically.

How the Price Impact Fee Helps:
1. Orderbook simulation
The fee structure mimics traditional order book dynamics, helping to prevent price manipulation. The fee structure ensures that the fee is proportional to the impact a trade might have on the market, making the environment fairer for both traders and liquidity providers.

2. Fair compensation for JLP holders

The price impact fee compensates for the undesirable delta imposed on the JLP. Traders will not benefit from splitting positions across different trades or addresses, as positions must be opened quickly before their alpha decays. The liquidity pool receives reasonable trading fees regardless of whether traders open large trades or split them up.

Jupiter works with partners like Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to set and optimize the price impact parameters above. The parameters may be adjusted over time as market conditions change. Consult the proposal and analysis on the price impact fee here for additional information on calculating the price impact fee and other useful information.

 

Borrow Fees
On the Jupiter Perpetuals exchange, traders can open leveraged positions by borrowing assets from the liquidity pool. In return, they pay borrow fees, which serve two key purposes:

Compensating Liquidity Providers – The fees ensure liquidity providers are rewarded for supplying assets to the pool.
Managing Risk – The fees help balance the risks associated with leveraged trading.
Unlike other exchanges that charge funding rates for open positions, Jupiter Perpetuals uses a borrow fee system. These fees compound hourly based on the amount borrowed for the leveraged position.

The borrow fees are reinvested back into the Jupiter Liquidity Pool (JLP), boosting its yield and liquidity. This also helps align the token mark price with its spot market price.

How the Borrow Fee Works:
The hourly borrow fee is calculated using the following formula:

Hourly Borrow Fee = Total Tokens Locked / Tokens in Pool (Utilization) × Hourly Borrow Rate × Position Size

Utilization: The proportion of tokens in the pool that are currently locked in open positions.
Total Tokens Locked: Tokens locked in all open positions.
Total Tokens in Pool: Tokens deposited into the liquidity pool for the position’s underlying token.
Hourly Borrow Rate: The base rate charged for borrowing, which varies by asset.
Position Size: The USD value of the leveraged position.
Finding Hourly Borrow Rates:

The hourly borrow rate for assets can be found in the Borrow Rate section of the trade form or accessed on-chain via the funding_rate_state.hourly_funding_dbps field in the custody account.

</aside>

Calculating Utilization Rate:
To calculate the utilization rate, use the following:

Copy
// Calculate utilization percentage if (custody.assets.owned > 0 AND custody.assets.locked > 0) then utilizationPct = custody.assets.locked / custody.assets.owned else utilizationPct = 0 // Get hourly funding rate in basis points hourlyFundingDbps = custody.fundingRateState.hourlyFundingDbps // Convert basis points to percentage and apply utilization hourlyBorrowRate = (hourlyFundingDbps / 1000) * utilizationPct
Worked Example:
Let’s say the price of SOL is $100. Here’s how the fee is calculated for a 100 SOL position:

Total Tokens Locked = 200 SOL (100 SOL from the position + 100 SOL in the pool)
Total Tokens in Pool = 1,010 SOL (1,000 SOL in custody + 10 SOL collateral)
Utilization = 200 SOL / 1,010 SOL = 19.8%
Hourly Borrow Rate = 0.012% (0.00012 in decimal)
Using the formula:

Hourly Borrow Fee = (200 / 1,010) × 0.00012 × 10,000 = 0.238 USD/hour.

This means your position will accrue a borrow fee of $0.238 every hour it remains open.

Important Considerations:

Ongoing Borrow Fees: Borrow fees are continuously deducted from your collateral, which impacts both your leverage and liquidation price over time.
Monitoring Fees: Since fees increase with position duration, it's important to regularly check your borrow fees and liquidation price to avoid unexpected liquidation, especially during volatile market conditions.
Note: Jupiter works with experts, like Gauntlet, to optimize borrow fees and ensure they remain fair and balanced for both traders and liquidity providers. You can check Gauntlet's analysis here.

 

Transaction and Priority Fees
Traders will have to pay SOL for submitting transactions onto the Solana chain. Traders also pay priority fees or Jito bundle tips (or both) depending on their settings.

At the same time, a minor SOL amount will be used for rent to create an escrow account (PDA). The SOL rent will be returned to you once you close your position.
