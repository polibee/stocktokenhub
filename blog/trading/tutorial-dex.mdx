## üéØ Why Choose Decentralized Exchanges?

**Core Advantages**:
- üîì **Permissionless**: No KYC required, anyone can use
- üîê **Self-Custody**: Private keys in your hands, complete fund control
- üåç **Global Access**: No geographical restrictions
- üîç **Complete Transparency**: All transactions public on blockchain
- üö´ **Censorship Resistant**: Cannot be shut down by single entity
- üí∞ **More Opportunities**: Participate in liquidity mining, staking and other DeFi activities

**Suitable For**:
- üî∞ Users wanting to experience DeFi
- üåç Users restricted from using CEX due to geography
- üîí Users valuing privacy and fund autonomy
- üí° Users wanting to participate in more DeFi protocols

**Considerations**:
- Requires some technical knowledge
- Self-responsibility for security
- Gas fees to consider
- Liquidity may be lower than CEX

## üèóÔ∏è DEX Infrastructure

### Automated Market Makers (AMM)

**Traditional Order Book vs AMM**:

| Feature | Order Book | AMM |
|---------|------------|-----|
| **Price Discovery** | Buyer/seller quotes | Algorithmic formula |
| **Liquidity** | Market makers provide | Liquidity pools |
| **Slippage** | Order book depth determines | Trade volume and pool size determine |
| **24/7 Trading** | Requires market makers online | Runs automatically |

**How AMM Works**:
1. Users deposit token pairs into liquidity pools (e.g., ETH/USDC)
2. Smart contracts use mathematical formulas for pricing
3. Traders trade with pools, not other users
4. Liquidity providers earn trading fee shares

### Common AMM Formulas

#### Constant Product (Uniswap V2)
```
x * y = k
```
- x, y: Quantities of two tokens in pool
- k: Constant value
- Features: Simple and reliable, but high slippage for large trades

#### Stablecoin AMM (Curve)
```
A * n^n * Œ£xi + D = A * D * n^n + D^(n+1) / (n^n * Œ†xi)
```
- Suitable for similar value assets (like stablecoins)
- Lower slippage

#### Concentrated Liquidity (Uniswap V3)
- Liquidity providers can choose price ranges
- Higher capital efficiency
- More complex management
